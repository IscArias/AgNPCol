Synthesis, Characterization, and Assessment of Collagen-Capped Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPCol)

This study focuses on synthesizing silver nanoparticles in a collagen-rich medium to potentially obtain collagen-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPCol). The characteriza-tion process of the AgNPCol employs UV-vis spectroscopy using a Nanodrop. Addi-tionally, spectrophotometry essay and ANOVA statistical analysis are used as auxilia-ry tools to estimate the optimal stability and binding efficiency ratio during the reac-tion process. Finally, given the bactericidal and antimicrobial nature of silver nanopar-ticles, a Broth Microdilution Assay is performed for evaluation purposes.
